# 1: Getting the modpack running

## 1.1: Forge
First off you need to install Forge version 35.1.37 for Minecraft version 1.16.4
There's plenty of existing guides for this.
All mods go into the mods folder in your `.minecraft` root folder.

## 1.2: Required mods
These mods are required to be able to join the server.
The corresponding file will have links to the download pages for all mods.
Why I'm not simple reuploading is answered in the FAQ section below (3.1)

Always make sure to download the correct version.
For example on CurseForge you'll see 2 download buttons.
The one at the top will be the latest version, while the other one, which'll also have an actual download icon, will be for the version you're looking at, but the latest version isn't always the version used on the server.
tldr: always use the download button with the icon on CurseForge.

Requirements for these mods will be listed with them, as well which mods require them. This is so if you want to play alone with a modified modlist or make your own server, you'll have the required information easily at hand.

## 1.3: Recommended mods
These are mods recommended but not required to join the server.
They range from usefull tools like Just Enough Items, Xaero's Minimap & Xaero's Worldmap, to mods that make the game feel better, but don't change any base functionality, like Optifine and Sound Filters.

Sometimes they require another mod, which will be indicated in the same manner as with required mods.

## 1.4: Miscellaneous mods
These are mods are similar to recommended mods, except that they're not for everyone.
A clear example would be Enhanced Visuals, as it has some features that greatly annoy some players, but give more immersion to others.

## 1.5: Serverside
This will include not only the mods, but also datapacks that are being used on the server.
There will be a great overlap with Required mods (1.2), and some minor overlap with Recommended mods (1.3), but some mods will only be used on the server, such as Discord Integration and DynmapForge.
Some of the serverside-onlly mods will still work in singleplayer, but some mods like Discord Integration is only meant to work on actual servers.

# 2: Joining the server
The Minecraft server is on an invite only basis.
The Discord server is however open to anyone.
To be invited you need to be in the Discord server and I need to be convinced that you'll be able to behave yourself.
Any further information should be listed in the Discord.

# 3: FAQ

## 3.1: Why links instead of an actual modpack or actual mod files?
While most mod authors have no issues with modpacks, some authors have specific rules.
Some authors prevent reuploading mods, even in modpack format to a modpack launcher such as TechnicLauncher, Curse Launcher, etc.
Other authors just don't like modpacks alltogether.
By using this method, we won't be breaking any legaly binding rules and we can still play together using the same modpack.

## 3.2: What about config files?
Currently I'm not planning on sharing my config files unless they **need** to be synchronized between client & server.
If enough demand is there, I might release them after all though.
