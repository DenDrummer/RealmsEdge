    3.1: Why links instead of actual mod files?

# 1: Getting the modpack running
## 1.1: Forge
First off you need to install Forge version ???? for Minecraft version 1.16.4
There's plenty of existing guides for this.
All mods go into the mods folder in your `.minecraft` root folder.
## 1.2: Required mods
These mods are required to be able to join the server.
The corresponding file will have links to the download pages for all mods.
Why I'm not simple reuploading is answered in the FAQ section below (3.1)

Always make sure to download the correct version.
For example on CurseForge you'll see 2 download buttons.
The one at the top will be the latest version, while the other one, which'll also have an actual download icon, will be for the version you're looking at, but the latest version isn't always the version used on the server.
tldr: always use the download button with the icon on CurseForge.

Requirements for these mods will be listed with them, as well which mods require them. This is so if you want to play alone with a modified modlist or make your own server, you'll have the required information easily at hand.
